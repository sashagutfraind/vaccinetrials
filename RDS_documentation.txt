The files "universal_cox.rds" and "universal_rsf.rds" are non-region specific versions of the Cox Proportional Hazards model
and the Random Survival Forest models that were trained using Chicago PWID data. The feature variables that were used to
train these models are:
	- Age (Numerical)
	- Gender (Categorical; levels: [male, female])
	- Syringe Source, whether or not the candidate utilizes harm reduction programs (Categorical; levels: [HR, nonHR])
	- Drug_in_degree, the number of PWID who give the candidate drugs/injection equipment (Numerical)
	- Drug_out_degree, the number of PWID who this candidate gives drugs/injection equipment to (Numerical)
	- current_total_network_size, the total number of people in the candidate's network (Numerical)
	- Daily_injection_intensity, the number of daily injection for a given candidate (Numerical)
	- Fraction_recept_sharing, the fraction of injections that involve receiving drugs or injection equipment from another
	  person in the network (Numerical)

To use these models, download the desired RDS file to the local machine. In R, set the directory to the location of the
downloaded RDS file, and use the readRDS() function in R to store the model in a variable. The model can be used to predict
infection probability using the relevant R predict function for candidates with known values for the above feature variables.
